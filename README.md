I am Andy Zhang, a guy who lives in Hong Kong and studying as a secondary student, and creates tools in various languages since 2020.

# Programming languages and tools

I know Python, Node.js, C++ and C#.
- All Python code is written using Sublime Text, with LSP plugin installed
- All C# code is written using Visual Studio for Mac
- All C++ code is written using CLion
- Images created using Adobe apps
I'm a Apple user by the way.
